# flutter_list_starting_point

This project has been made for the event <a href="https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-firenze-presents-introduzione-a-flutter/">"Introduzione a Flutter"</a>, to introduce developers to Flutter.<br>
On YouTube you can find the presentation I made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sklK05WyQEA"> for the GDG Florence</a>.

In this project, we will see how to create an app containing:
<ul>
  <li>a list having draggable (dismissable) items</li>
  <li>a text area to write some inputs</li>
  <li>a button to update the list with the given input</li>
</ul>
